Inspiration
Some “education” is often necessary to have a smooth healthy pregnancy. Ideally, a mom-to-be will actively seek the information and have their own independent learning. But alas, that seems that’s not always the case.

Sometimes people forget. It takes discipline to keep on learning and more so to take action based on the learning. Thus, we come to the idea of gamification. Integrating the information sharing and reminder into a game. Virtual pet genre appears as the proper choice as the game requires a daily login and the genre is seemingly popular among the target demographics. These all led us to make MORA. 

“Mom Pregnancy Assitance “

What it does
In addition to the often-found mechanics in virtual pet games (hunger, hygiene, and fun), “Mora” will periodically give small snippets of information and ask about things that needed to be tracked during pregnancy. You know, things like taking iron and folic acid supplement to things like having enough exercise. The information recorded could be seen and used as reference to have a general outlook on the relevant factors that the woman experienced during the pregnancy.
